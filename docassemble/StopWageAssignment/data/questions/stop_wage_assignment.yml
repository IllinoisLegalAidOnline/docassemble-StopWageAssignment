question: |
  Stopping a wage assignment
subquestion: |
  To stop a **{wage assignment}**, you need to tell your creditor that you are revoking it. You also need to tell your employer.
  
  This program will make two notices:
  
  * A Revocation Notice telling your creditor you want to stop the wage assignment, and
  * An Employer Notice that tells your employer to stop paying your creditor directly from your paycheck.

  After you download your notices, you must deliver the Revocation Notice to your creditor and both notices to your employer. See the instructions you can download at the end of this program for more information.

subquestion: | 
  A **{wage assignment}** for child support, federal student loans, and taxes is treated differently than other wage assignments. If so, you may want to discuss it with a lawyer.

subject: |
  **Tell me more about wage assignments**
content: |
  A wage assignment is a document you sign when you take out a loan. It gives the lender permission to take money from your wages if you don't pay.
  
  Usually, a creditor has to go to court to take part of your wages. This is called wage garnishment. However, with a wage assignment, a creditor can take your wages without going to court.
  
  To learn more, read ILAO's article about [**how wage assignments work**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/legal-information/understanding-wage-assignment).

question: |
  Sorry
subquestion: |
  In order to revoke a wage assignment using this program, you must first have a wage assignment for a debt other than child support, taxes or federal student loans. You said that you do not have such a wage assignment.
  
  Child support, taxes, and federal student loans are treated differently than other wage assignments. You may want to discuss your issue with a lawyer. Use [**Get Legal Help**](https://www.illinoislegalaid.org/get-legal-help) to find free or low-cost legal services in your area.
